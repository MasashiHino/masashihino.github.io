This is a webpage for my teaching at Hitotsubashi University.  

* syllabus: pdf (in Japanese. to be uploaded)
* textbook: [A Course in Modern Macroeconomics](https://sites.google.com/view/pkurlat/a-course-in-modern-macroeconomics) written by Prof. Pablo Kurlat
  * I will not follow the textbook very exactly. 
    * I will use easy parts in the textbook mainly and may skip difficult parts. Also, I will refer to some other textbooks sometimes.
  * But, overall, there are no equivalent-level or substitutable textbooks in Japanese. This textbook is the best among I know.
